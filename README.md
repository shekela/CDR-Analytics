# CDR Analytics API - Project Documentation

## Overview
CDR (Call Detail Record) Analytics API is a project designed to handle large CSV uploads containing call records and 
provide insightful analytics through various endpoints. The project follows SOLID principles and 
utilizes Entity Framework Core for data management.

## Steps Completed

### 1. **Project Initialization**
- Created a new .NET project.
- Added necessary dependencies, including `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` and `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`.
- Configured `appsettings.json` for database connection.

### 2. **Interface Definitions (Interfaces/)**
- Created `ICDRService.cs` to define business logic methods.
- Created `ICDRRepository.cs` to define data access methods.

### 3. **Database Setup (Data/)**
- Implemented `ApplicationDbContext.cs` for managing EF Core database context.
- Defined the `CDR` entity and applied necessary indexing.
- Encountered and resolved errors related to missing `EntityFrameworkCore` reference.

### 4. **Indexing in `OnModelCreating`**
- Used `HasIndex()` to improve query performance on key columns:
  ```csharp
  modelBuilder.Entity<CDR>()
      .HasIndex(c => c.CallDate)
      .HasDatabaseName("Idx_CallDate");

  modelBuilder.Entity<CDR>()
      .HasIndex(c => c.CallerID)
      .HasDatabaseName("Idx_CallerID");

  modelBuilder.Entity<CDR>()
      .HasIndex(c => c.Recipient)
      .HasDatabaseName("Idx_Recipient");
  ```
- Fixed issue where `HasDatabaseName()` was not recognized by using `HasName()` instead.

### 5. **Configuration & Debugging**
- Fixed missing `EntityFrameworkCore` reference by adding the necessary NuGet packages:
  ```sh
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
  dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
  ```
- Restored and rebuilt the project:
  ```sh
  dotnet restore
  dotnet build
  ```
- Verified database connection and migrations setup.

## Next Steps
- Implement business logic in `CDRService.cs`.
- Implement data access logic in `CDRRepository.cs`.
- Develop controllers and endpoints for querying call data.
- Optimize large CSV uploads with batch processing.
- Implement unit and integration tests.

## Notes
- The project follows clean architecture with a separation of concerns.
- Indexed fields (`CallDate`, `CallerID`, `Recipient`) improve database performance.
- EF Core configuration ensures maintainability and scalability.
